About the company
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. It was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur in 2013. Since it was founded, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. 

Case scenario
Even though Bellabeat has expanded quickly and established itself as a market leader, the firm is constantly looking for ways to expand and rise to the top of the global digital market. Urška Sršen thinks that by finding out more about the data on smart device usage, Bellabeat may finally be able to fulfill its business objective by discovering new opportunities and insights. 
Main objective: The primary objective is to ascertain prospective avenues for expansion and offer suggestions for enhancing Bellabeat's marketing approach by considering patterns in the use of smart devices.

I will follow the data analysis process of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act in order to answer some key business questions. 

The tools used: Microsoft Excel, MySQL Workbench and Tableau Public

Key deliverables: By the end of the analysis, I will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1.	A clear summary of the business task
2.	A description of all data sources used
3.	Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4.	A summary of the analysis
5.	Supporting visualizations and key findings
6.	Top high-level content recommendations based on the analysis

Summary of the business task:
The company has a portfolio of five products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. Sršen has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. 
I am a part of Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team. We are a team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and repo ing data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. My task as a junior data analyst is to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. I need to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in my presentation.
